# APRS

Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS) is an amateur radio based system for real time data communication of location reporting and messaging.

I use APRSDroid on my Android phone which is a great tool for reporting my location, speed and altitude to [ARPS.FI](ARPS.FI) I normally use APRS when mobile in the car, on the bike or walking.

I also operate a APRS I-Gate which runs on a Raspberry PI B+ with a SDR dongle. This allows for a compact 24/7 local or portable setup.

I used to have my WX (Weather) Station on APRS but currently my Weather Station is broken.

You can see my nodes on this map view of Bristol via [aprs.fi](https://aprs.fi/#!mt=roadmap&z=11&lat=51.4829&lng=-2.6549&timerange=3600) or via the below embedded map:
