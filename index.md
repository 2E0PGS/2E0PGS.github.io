# Welcome to my website

## About

_Fun fact: this website is written using Markdown a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. The Markdown source files then get rendered into HTML via [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) on Github._

This site has recently been written as an experiment to see if I can supersede my old Weebly website: [m3pgs.co.uk](http://www.m3pgs.co.uk) So far it's working better than expected. I decided on using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) since it supports rendering from Markdown a language that I have been using more and more of recently.

Anyway here you will find a collection of topics which evolve around my hobbies. Mostly Computers, Music and Electronics.

A lot of the content here at the moment revolves around Ham Radio but I plan to expand this site to support more content around my other hobbies.

I plan to add a blog to this [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) site so I can post tips and tricks I have come across into simple blog posts which can be indexed via search engines. I am not one of those people who like to blog about my life story. However I will share useful tips on any topic I see fit.
