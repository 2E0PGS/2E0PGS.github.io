# Welcome to my website

## About

Here you will find a collection of topics which evolve around my hobbies. Mostly Computing, Music, Ham radio and Electronics.

I also have a blog which is hosted as a separate Jekyll site. It runs in parallel to my website on many topics but hosts content that's more date/time specific: [My blog](https://2e0pgs.github.io/blog/)

_Fun fact: this website is written using Markdown a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. The Markdown source files then get rendered into HTML via [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) on Github._
