# IC-7100

This is a fantastic radio for the modern ham! I recently acquired one to replace several other band specific radios in an attempt to clean up my shacks wire problem.

Mostly using it for FM, SSB and D-Star modes.

## AF/IF over USB

I also experiment with it's AF/IF over USB.

* I can RX/TX WSPR using WSJT-X without the need for a RIGblaster or lots of cables.
* USB AF/IF output can go right into GQRX as a sound card.
* Allows me to enable UDP out in GQRX so I can pipe raw audio into DSD or multimon-ng.
* Provides waterfalls for spectrum analysis in GQRX. I used this for [IC-E208 Calibration](https://2e0pgs.github.io/blog/hamradio/2019/05/25/ic-e208-calibration/) recently.
* Also see my blog post: [IC-7100 USB data mode operation](https://2e0pgs.github.io/blog/hamradio/2020/07/29/ic-7100-usb-data-mode-operation/)

### [Hamlib](https://github.com/Hamlib/Hamlib)

I can control my IC-7100 automatically on a scheduled basis using a crontab entry in Linux. This all works over a single USB cable.

## Logging all the things

I have my IC-7100 record various activities and that was a main selling point the logging feature. Below is a list of a few repositories I update with data extracted from my IC-7100:

* [RTTY Logs](https://bitbucket.org/2E0PGS/ham-radio-logbook-ic-7100-rtty)
* [D-Star RX Logs](https://bitbucket.org/2E0PGS/ham-radio-logbook-ic-7100-d-star-rx)
* [D-Star QSO Logs](https://bitbucket.org/2E0PGS/ham-radio-logbook-ic-7100-d-star-qso)
