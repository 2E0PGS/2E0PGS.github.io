# IC-7100

This is a fantastic radio for the modern ham! I recently acquired one to replace several other band specific radios in an attempt to clean up my shacks wire problem.

I use it for FM, SSB and D-Star mostly but I will shortly be experimenting with it's AF/IF over USB so I can decode and possibly TX WSPR and other data modes without a RIGblaster and loads of cables.

I have my IC-7100 record various activities and that was a main selling point the logging feature. Below is a list of a few repositories I update with data extracted from my IC-7100:

* [RTTY Logs](https://bitbucket.org/2E0PGS/ham-radio-logbook-ic-7100-rtty)
* [D-Star RX Logs](https://bitbucket.org/2E0PGS/ham-radio-logbook-ic-7100-d-star-rx)
* [D-Star QSO Logs](https://bitbucket.org/2E0PGS/ham-radio-logbook-ic-7100-d-star-qso)
