# APRS

Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS) is an amateur radio based system for real time data communication of location reporting and messaging.

More info a﻿t:

* [APRS.FI](APRS.FI)
* [APRS.ORG](APRS.ORG)
* ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿[APRSDROID.ORG](APRSDROID.ORG)

I use APRSDroid on my Android phone which is a great tool for reporting my location, speed and altitude to [ARPS.FI](ARPS.FI) I normally use APRS when mobile in the car, on the bike or walking.

I also operate a APRS I-Gate which runs on a Raspberry PI B+ with a SDR dongle. This allows for a compact 24/7 local or portable setup.

I used to have my WX (Weather) Station on APRS but currently my Weather Station is broken.

## SSIDs

* 2E0PGS (main home base station radio)
* 2E0PGS-5 (mobile with my backup phone)
* 2E0PGS-7 (mobile with a hand held)
* 2E0PGS-9 (mobile with my main phone)
* 2E0PGS-10 (APRS I-Gate)
* 2E0PGS-B (D-Star hotspot and DPRS I-Gate)
