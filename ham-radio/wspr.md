# WSPR

WSPR stands for "Weak Signal Propagation Reporter". More info about WSPR can be found here:

WSPR is a great tool for checking band conditions, atmospheric conditions and for testing how well certain antennas performs.

I run WSPR mostly on 20m and 40m bands. Below is a repository with a log of my WSPR contacts extracted from [wsprnet.org/archive](http://wsprnet.org/archive/) via a script I wrote to parse the files and grep for my call sign:
