# SDR is awesome

Here is a list of stuff I have done with SDR.

* Spectrum analysis
* Reverse engineering protocols and data modes
* PAN adapters using the IF output of a radio
* RF interference tracking
* APRS I-Gate using pymultimonaprs
* Terrestrial TV reception with rtl dongle
* IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
* Decoded various data modes using SDR drivers with UDP streams, TCP streams or audio pipes in Linux. See: [Data modes](/ham-radio/data-modes.html)
* Run a DVB-T tvheadend server from a RTL dongle

## Future projects

* Run a Weewx website with rtl-433 input
* OpenWebRX server

## Open Source SDR tools and apps

* See ham radio section: [Awesome FOSS](/extra/awesome-foss.html)

## Mobile SDR

* Raspberry PI with power bank.
* Android using rtl-sdr driver app for rtl-tcp like server.
* Termux and rtl-433 see: [Portable Android signal recorder #892](https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433/issues/892)
* Various other closed source apps on the "Google Play Store" often paid.
