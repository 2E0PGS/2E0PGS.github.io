# DVAP

I am currently experimenting with Jumbospots and DV mini using PI-STAR for D-Star operation via my IC-7100.

I plan to test the output of these various hotspots to see how clean they are and post the results on my website.

## Jumbospot

Below are the spectrum analyser results. Not bad I am impressed, this is all without any external filtering.

1KHz bandwidth spectrum analysis
