# DVAP (Digital Voice Access Points)

I am currently experimenting with Jumbospots and DV mini using Pi-Star for D-Star operation via my IC-7100 and ID-51A.

## Jumbospot

Below are the spectrum analyser results. Not bad I am impressed, this is all without any external filtering.

I have achieved a mile range with a less than ideal mobile dual band antenna setup, attached to the hotspot on the first floor (British English).

Overall the best hotspot I have tested so far.

## MMDVM dual duplex

Slightly deaf and not as much output power when compared to the Jumbospot. Probably due to the close proximity of the antenna.

## DV mini USB dongle

Tied to specific software in my testing. That software I found hard to acquire due to missing mirrors.
