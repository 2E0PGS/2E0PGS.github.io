# Music

### Sub Pages

* [My audio setup](/music/audio-setup.html)
* [Trance](/music/trance.html)

Music is a key part of my life. I have a vast musical taste but I know where my interests are. I think it's important for people to know what genres they like instead of just saying "I like everything". This relates to more philosophy in life than just ones musical interests.

Below I will list links to subsections of this music section. They are separated / categorised by genre. ​(A grouping based on shared similar characteristics).

**Don't expect this to have a full representation of my musical tastes as I cannot fit all that in a website page!**

​However I will try to get some important tracks that have influenced my life posted in the subsections below.

These are not in any kind of order. Some will get populated before others as this is a new section of my website.

However I must say Trance has to be my all time favorite and most influencing genre! It is so incredibly complex and diverse!

Appreciate feedback if you enjoy the music.

I used to listen to tonnes of internet radio which helped me gain roots in world music. Alot of German and Ibiza electronic internet radio stations. Either trance, techno or chill / lounge mostly.

### Psychedelic Trance

Most of my psy trance interest is from Goa Trance. Which originates from Goa in India. Psychedelic drug use, ancient Asian musical instruments and religious practices of deep meditation!

### House

House music is probably my second favorite genre for many reasons.

* Deep rhythmic beats that vibrate your soul.
* Has that classic drum machine sound.
* Very relaxing it can help you meditate and repair without actually meditating.
* Has cross over with some early techno tracks.

### IDM (electronic music that emerged in the early 1990s)

### Synth Pop (short for synthesizer pop prominent in the late 1970s)

### OST (Original Sound Track, mostly focusing on game sound tracks)

Producers for computer game OST's have just as much influence as full fledged music producers. They just often choose to only produce for computer games since it fits with their style of music. You can find some of the most interesting music this way as the music often portrays a theme or setting of an area in the game. For example dark spooky level or boss level with loads of action.

### ​New Wave (rock music popular in late 1970s and the 1980s with ties to mid-1970s punk rock)

### Drum and Bass

Most of my tastes in DnB come from the 90s where you get that classic synth, deep complex relaxing synth pads and drum machines such as the 909 or 808. The only other decent DnB time frame was a couple years around 2009 where there was a modern DnB scene reappearing. However that soon diminished and only a few decent tracks came of it.
