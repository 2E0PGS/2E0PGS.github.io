# Audio Setup

This is a list of my current main HI-FI system setup. It does change now and then and I will try to keep this page updated to reflect that. I have also included a few portable audio devices in the list.

### Speakers

Aiwa SX NV-150 "twin duct three way bass reflex speaker system"

Decent speakers with a strong bass. Suprising quality when I have compared them to much more expensive kevlar speakers. However I would still like to upgraded them at some point.

### Amplifier

[NAD Stero Amplifier 3020i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAD_3020) (1978 ish)

Clear audio amp with lots of punch for its size. It's probably one of my favorite amps I ever used. Simple interface without lots of useless features.

### CD player

[Sony CDP-XE900E](http://www.audioreview.com/product/digital-sources/cd-players/sony/cdp-xe900.html) (1996)

Very good CD player has all the features I need and a nice clear large display. Solid built CD tray which uses a "Fixed Pick-up Mechanism".

### Vinyl deck

[Technics SL-Q2](https://www.vinylengine.com/library/technics/sl-q2.shtml) (1979-1981)

I love the automatic function of this deck. It means I wont wear out my stylus if I leave the room and the vinyl finishes playing. The arm will automatically park up. The direct drive for me is better with less to go wrong and the quartz tracking seems to work well.

### Vinyl needle/cartridge

[ADC QLM 33 MKIII](https://www.turntableneedles.com/RSQ33-Type-Needle-for-ADC-QLM-33-MKIII--our-Needle-111-DEC_p_856.html)

Great quality audio. Nice bass and treble response.

### PC DAC

Realtek ALC887

### Ear-Canal headphones

[Sennheiser CX 475](https://www.stuff.tv/sennheiser/cx-475/review)

Great quality however the bass is lacking unless it's snug in the ear. Drives well of the phones DAC. The trebel response is brilliant.
