### Ubiquity Device VLAN Guide:

​I personally suggest HP Switches if you can get ahold of them however another option is the cheap Netgear GS108e or GS105e available on amazon. The HP Switches have a more logical configuration panel which can make it a little easier. Ensure you get a "802.1Q" compatible "managed" switch! 802.1Q meaning the switch supports VLAN Tagging.
