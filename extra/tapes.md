## Duct Tapes

### Duck Tape Original

### Duck Tape Ultimate

### Gorilla Tape

### 3M Duct Tape

### T Rex Tape

Very strong adhesion however it doesn't work well if you're trying to stick two bits of metal together which are pulling apart since the adhesion will slowly move with the metal.

This tape I have however used to prevent a leak in a cracked bathtub and it's still holding up 3 weeks later just fine. So it would appear this tape is pretty water proof.
