# Tea

I am a massive tea advocate. Don't add sugar as this ruins the purity.

## Tea bags

### Lipton

[Lipton Yellow Label Tea Bags](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lipton-Yellow-Label-Bags-100ct/dp/B00U9WRZX4)

If you want black tea in America this will suffice.

### Clipper

Nettle

Mango Green Tea

Dandelion & Burdock

[Fair Trade](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Clipper-Fairtrade-Everyday-Bags-1100/dp/B0053PLUVA/)

### Twinings

Green Tea

Jasmine Green Tea

Cranberry & Blood Orange

English Breakfast

Strong English Breakfast

Earl Grey

[Smoky Lapsang]()

Not that good. Your better going for loose Lapsang for a real flavour.

Camomile

Camomile & Honey

Assam

[Spicy Chai](https://www.twinings.co.uk/tea/chai/spicy-chai-50-tea-bags)

Tastes good although you need to combine it with a second English black tea bag or it's far too weak.

### Yorkshire

### PG Tips

Decafe

Extra Strong?

Pretty much all their teas I have tried have licorice in them. If you like licorice then happy days.

Not as good as the Gold Label. A bit more powdery.

### Asda

[Extra Special Chai](https://groceries.asda.com/product/herbal-tea/asda-extra-special-chai-tea-50-bags/1000138208755)

## Tea equipment

[Porcelain tea pot]()

The traditional English tea pot. Decent insulation and can be coupled with a tea cosy if required. Very fragile however.

[Steel tea pot]()

Best all around option.

[Glass tea pot]()

Looks impressive however not very practical. Also requires cleaning to keep it's appearance. More for herbal or green tea use.

[Argon Cast Iron Tea Pot](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01CUCXCW8/)

Rusted so therefore poor design. Also tea coolers quicker. Very heavy. Lid gets extremely hot and therefore is tricky to remove.

[Strainer](https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/shop/gb/groceries/sainsburys-tea-strainer)

Another option is to poor the tea slowly out the pot. Racking off the tea.

[Milk](https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/shop/gb/groceries/sainsburys-british-whole-milk-227l-%284-pint%29)

I suggest blue top milk aka whole milk. Semi-skimmed will suffice.

Tea spoon

Used to measure out loose tea. One tea spoon per a person and one for the pot.

## Iced tea

### Tetley 

[Tetley Cold Infusions - Mint, Lemon & Cucumber](https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/301210274)

Probably one of the best iced tea bags I have found. Sometimes it can even be too strong an infusion.

[Redbush Pure](https://www.tetley.co.uk/all-drinks/redbush/tetley-redbush-pure)

Very odd strong smell, taste isn't quite as odd. Okay with a little milk for a night time drink.

### Lipton

[Lipton Real Iced Black Tea, Peach & Apricot](https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/303718811)

I don't like it at all. Sweet and doesn't infuse too well.

[Lipton Lemon Iced Tea Mix](https://www.lipton.com/us/en/our-teas/lemon-iced-tea-mix.html)

Sweet sugary stuff. Fine if that's what you're after. American style iced tea.
