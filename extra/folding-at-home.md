# Folding At Home

"Folding@home (FAH) is a distributed computing project for disease research that simulates protein folding."

I have ran a few clients over the years such as the Windows and Linux fahclient. However I mostly just use the [NACL chrome browser client](https://nacl.foldingathome.org/) thesedays. It requires no install and seems to be more efficient and make better use of the CPU power available.
