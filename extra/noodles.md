# Noodles

Flavour rating under 5 means I probably wont be repurchasing.

## Packets

### Indomie

[Indomie Mi Goreng Instant Noodles Pedas](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B005PTQDZC/) (7/10 flavour)

Decent but not as much flavour as Ibumie Penang.

[Indomie Mi Goreng Fried Instant Noodles](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00ZIVMLGW) (2/10 flavour)

Tastes old and too oily.

### Ibumie

[Ibumie Penang White Curry Mee](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B06XXJ2BZZ/) (9/10 flavour)

Great creamy curry taste. Maybe a little on the fishy side.

### PRIMA

[PRIMA TASTE SINGAPORE LAKSA LAMIAN]() (10/10 flavour)

Goes really well with two fresh Carolina Reaper chilli's chopped up into it. One of the best if not the best instant noodles you can buy.

### Nong Shim

[Nong Shim Shin Noodle Ramyun Packet]()

I would recommend the bowl version instead.

### Ko-Lee

[Ko-Lee Xtreme Hot & Spicy Go Instant Noodles]() (3/10 flavour)

Pretty bad, wouldn't advise anyone to buy.

### Koka

[Koka Oriental Style Instant Noodles - Spicy Stir-Fried Flavour](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Koka-Oriental-Style-Instant-Noodles/dp/B06XX2RZJ4/) (7/10 flavour)

This is one of the cheapest most flavourful noodles I found. Very spicy too. They're also available in "Home Bargains" stores in England, UK for Â£0.25p.

### Nissin

[Nissin Demae Ramen Spicy Instant Noodles](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nissin-Demae-Ramen-Instant-Noodles/dp/B00KA82CRQ)

Decent for cheap noodles from Tesco. A little on the slimy side however.

[Nissin Chicken Flavour Instant Noodles](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nissin-Chicken-Flavour-Instant-Noodles/dp/B004SGTUMQ)

Better off getting the spicy version.

[Nissin Beef Flavour Noodles](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nissin-Beef-Flavour-Noodles-Packets/dp/B004SH0KRY)

Better off getting the spicy version.

[Nissin Sesame Oil Flavour Instant Noodles](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nissin-Sesame-Flavour-Instant-Noodles/dp/B007FCXRHY/)

Better off getting the spicy version.

### Samyang

[Samyang Hot Chicken Flavour Ramen (2xSpicy) Limited Edition](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Samyang-Chicken-Flavour-2xSpicy-Limited/dp/B07119KZZJ/)

Surprisingly hot. But not the best flavour. May need to revisit as only had the one packet.

[Samyang Dried Noodle Buldak Bag Noodles](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00GE1XKHY/)

Really spicy stuff. However a little on the sweet side.

### Paldo

[Paldo Volcano Chicken Noodle (Artificial Beef & Chicken Flavour)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B075ZRJDK4/)

Almost as spicy as Samyang. Bit thinner noodles. Probably better flavour however.

### VIFON

[VIFON Chilli Chicken Instant Noodles](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07MB4B9XF)

These noodles require no active cooking. Just pour boiling water over them and let them sit. Spicy and great for a instant snack noodle.

### Batchelors

[Batchelors Super Noodles Barbecue Beef Flavour](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Batchelors-Super-Noodles-Barbecue-Flavour/dp/B007XR27AE)

Their best flavour. However their flavouring seems to cause a body odour as strange as this sounds. It must be some artificial chemical. Goes very soft/sticky if you like soft noodles.

[Batchelors Super Noodles Chicken Flavour](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Batchelors-Super-Noodles-Chicken-Flavour/dp/B01EX15TIE)

Goes very soft/sticky if you like soft noodles.

### MyKuali

[MyKuali Penang Red Tom Yum Goong Noodle](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01AYGDYHU)

TBA

[MyKuali Penang Hokkien Prawn Noodle](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0199APM22/)

Extremely fishy. The most fishy noodles I have ever had, it's like the ocean. However it has a nice flavour if you enjoy sea food! Not really spicy.

## Bowl/Cup (self contained)

### Nong Shim

[Nong Shim Shin Instant Noodle Cup]() (6/10 flavour)

The bowl version is better. Thicker noodles.

[Nong Shim Shin Noodle Big Bowl]() (7/10 flavour)

Sweet but decent chilli kick.

### Kabuto

[Kabuto Noodles Chicken Ramen]() (5/10 flavour)

It has a unique flavour but it's not very filling.

### Pot Noodle

[Pot Noodle King Bombay Badboy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pot-Noodle-Bombay-Badboy-Flavour/dp/B007XR2JZ2)

The best pot noodle version perhaps.

[Pot Noodle Chicken and Mushroom](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pot-Noodle-Chicken-Mushroom-Noodles/dp/B06XP9RLQM)

The most common pot noodle variant.

[Pot Noodle Sticky Rib Noodles](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pot-Noodle-Sticky-Rib-Noodles/dp/B06XP9Y2K7/)

TBA

[Pot Noodle King Original Curry Flavour](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pot-Noodle-Original-Curry-Flavour/dp/B007XR2IM6/)

Add some Devonshire Chilli company reaper sauce to this for a awesome flavour.

### Nissin

[Nissin Classic Soba Noodles with Yakisoba Sauce](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nissin-Classic-Noodles-Yakisoba-Sauce/dp/B00V3NGLVK/)

### Batchelors

[Batchelors Super BBQ Beef Flavour Noodles](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Batchelors-Super-Beef-Flavour-Noodles/dp/B073HBXY3N)

They recently launched this cup range. I recommend the normal packet version however.
