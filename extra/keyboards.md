# Keyboards

## Mechanical

### Razer BlackWidow Chroma (Original) (Razer Green Switches)

* [My documentation on it's feature set](https://github.com/2E0PGS/razer-blackwidow-chroma-features)

I own two of these and they're great keyboards for Linux users thanks to the following projects which enable configuration of the keyboard under Linux:

* [OpenRazer](https://github.com/openrazer/openrazer)
* [Polychromatic](https://github.com/polychromatic/polychromatic)

This keyboard has a great feel for typists. Highly recommended.

### Razer BlackWidow (Original) (Cherry MX Blue Switches)

It's unfortunately a US layout that I own, this prevents me from liking it as much as I want to. Besides that it's a great keyboard and it compares almost identical to the Razer Green Switches. This version does not have any back lighting either so it's not great for illuminating custom hot keys.

## Membrane

### Apple Keyboard

Great chicklet style keys which allow for fast typing because it's pretty effortless to press and easy to glide your hands across the key caps.
