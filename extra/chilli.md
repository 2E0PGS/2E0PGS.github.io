# Chilli

## Sauces

### Psycho Juice

[Psycho Juice - 70% Habanero](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dr-Burnoriums-Psycho-Juice-Habanero/dp/B005NNN6W8) (4/10 heat level)

Decent flavour but lacks in heat. I use this one too quickly to warrant buying it all the time. However it adds lovely pepper flavour to any sauce base just a shame it's not sold in larger quantities and cheaper.

[Psycho Juice 70% - Red Savina](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psycho-Juice-70-Red-Savina/dp/B005MSZG22) (5/10 heat level)

One of my favourite sauces for flavouring. Such a lovely flavour from this chilli.

[Psycho Juice - Chipotle Ghost Pepper](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psycho-Juice-Chipotle-Ghost-Pepper/dp/B008CRD9HE) (7/10 heat level)

It's not for me since there’s roasted onions in it. However it works in a sauce to add complexity to the base.

[Psycho Juice - Roasted Garlic Ghost Pepper](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00O6TP6FA) (7/10 heat level)

Full of flavour and nice chunky thick sauce. Makes a great pizza dip. Not overly garlicy incase your worried about that.

[Psycho Juice - 70% Ghost Pepper](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psycho-Juice-70-Ghost-Pepper/dp/B005MSE5KG)

[Psycho Juice - Extreme Ghost Pepper](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B008CRSEUG/) (8/10 heat level)

When a company that's called Psycho Juice say something is extreme they really mean it. This is damn hot sauce. A spoonful of this had my face melting. Similar heat level to Dave's Gourmet Ghost Pepper Sauce but a lot slower building heat.

[Psycho Juice - Mustard Ghost Pepper](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psycho-Juice-Mustard-Ghost-Pepper/dp/B008CRN9SS/) (6/10 heat level)

This is a lovely flavourful sauce. Makes a great pizza dip instead of using honey mustard. Not overly extreme heat either. I Recommend it if you like honey mustard and chilli sauces.

[Psycho Juice - 70% Scorpion Pepper](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psycho-Juice-70-Scorpion-Pepper/dp/B00EZMNZMY) (8/10 heat level)

This sauce smells just like scorpion peppers right away. You know it's deadly. If you want to make some of the hottest noodles or chilli dishes around this is sure to help facilitate that. Not bad on a spoon but add it to a dish and it soon catches up with you.

[Psycho Pickles - Ghost Pepper](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00ND6PYCW) (7/10 heat level)

My favourite gherkins/pickles. Lovely heat level just don't eat too many at once or you will pay for it tomorrow. Sweet fresh small gherkins.

### The Chilli Alchemist

[The Chilli Alchemist - The Smoke Potion](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01EN8GFOE) (4/10 heat level)

Not very hot and uses "liquid smoke", this causes it too taste chemically.

[The Chilli Alchemist - The Smoke Potion Magnum Opus](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01EN8GFOE) (4/10 heat level)

Same story as "The Smoke Potion" but a little hotter.

[The Chilli Alchemist - The Red King](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01EN8GFOE) (4/10 heat level)

Decent wine smell and flavour. No fake flavouring in this one.

[The Chilli Alchemist - The Everlasting Flame](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Chilli-Alchemist-Philosophers-Magnum-Everlasting/dp/B01ELY0OHO) (5/10 heat level)

Decent fresh lime flavour. No fake flavouring in this one.

### Pain Is Good/Original Juan

[Da' Bomb! Ground Zero](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001BIXK70) (9/10 heat level)

Not the best flavour however it certainly smells of pineapples. It's a wolf in sheep’s clothing though. This sauce looks innocent with it's low Scoville rating however it will burn a hole in your tongue so to speak. Use sparingly.

### Dave's Gourmet

[Dave's Gourmet - Ultimate Insanity](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001C316QG) (7/10 heat level)

I prefer Dave's Gourmet - Naga Jolokia Ghost Pepper instead as it has better flavour and more heat in my opinion.

[Dave's Gourmet - Naga Jolokia Ghost Pepper](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Daves-Gourmet-Jolokia-Ghost-Pepper/dp/B001PQTYN2)  (8/10 heat level)

This stuff is instant needles and instant heat. Add this to any dip for a real heat kick. It's brutal stuff.

[Dave's Insanity Limited Edition Private Reserve 2014](https://www.hot-headz.com/daves-insanity-limited-edition-private-reserve-2013) (8/10 heat level)

This stuff smells and tastes like play dough unfortunately. This is probably because it's mostly extract. Although my other extracts normally just have a metallic taste. Wouldn't recommend buying this.

### Ginger Beards Preserves

[Ginger Beards Preserves - Fermented Scotch Sriracha](https://www.gingerbeardspreserves.co.uk/product/fermented-scotch-sriracha/) (7/10 heat level)

Brilliant sauce and slightly alcoholic tasting from the scotch blended.

[Ginger Beards Preserves - Habanero](https://www.gingerbeardspreserves.co.uk/product/habanero-hot-sauce/) (4/10 heat level)

Quite a chunky and thick sauce. Not overly hot but that's expected. Makes a great dipping sauce and great for guests to enjoy without blowing their head off. Many flavours and all natural.

[Ginger Beards Preserves - Moor Ghost Pepper Fusion](https://www.gingerbeardspreserves.co.uk/product/moor-ghost-pepper-fusion/) (8/10 heat level)

This is a damn excellent hot sauce. Made with real natural ingredients no fake flavouring. Seriously hot with serious flavour. This is a craft chilli sauce made with craft beer! Two of my favourite things! Smoky, spicy and chunky.

### The Chilli Pepper Company

[The Chilli Pepper Company - El Diablo](http://www.chileseeds.co.uk/products/el-diablo-hot-chilli-sauce-775.php)

Very hot sauce great in any noodle dish or chilli-con-carne. A few spices like pepper.

[The Chilli Pepper Company - The Beast](http://www.chileseeds.co.uk/products/the-beast-hot-chilli-sauce-30.php)

Quite a sweet sauce but good for sausages or other meats as a dip.

### Morrisons

[Morrisons Ghost Chilli Hot Sauce](https://groceries.morrisons.com/webshop/product/Morrisons-Ghost-Chilli-Hot-Sauce/383152011) (7/10 heat level)

Pretty hot stuff for a supermarket hot sauce. Impressive ghost flavour. It kinda tastes like a mix of salad cream and hot sauce. Great for any salad cream lovers and it does go well on salads which already have mayonnaise on them.

### ASDA

[ASDA Jalapeño Chilli Sauce](https://groceries.asda.com/product/hot-chilli-sauces/asda-jalapeo-chilli-sauce/1000034965784) (1/10 heat level)

Terrible stuff and a awful gloopy syrupy consistency. I wouldn't use it on anything.

[ASDA Habanero Chilli Sauce](https://groceries.asda.com/product/hot-chilli-sauces/asda-habanero-chilli-sauce/1000034965949) (2/10 heat level)

Same story as the ASDA Jalapeño Chilli Sauce but slightly better flavour. I still wouldn't use this on anything. It's a syrupy sugar sauce that has a awful consistency.

### Chilli Wizards

[Chilli Wizards - Venom](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B078SW875Z) (8/10 heat level)

Very good value for money sauce. Sure it's not 80% reaper but it's surprisingly powerful still.

[Chilli Wizards - Phantom](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B078SW875Z) (7/10 heat level)

Again they have another great value sauces here.

### Daddy Cool

[Jeepers Reapers Revenge](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B014O6RIZA/) (8/10 heat level)

You can taste the reaper and it's kicking strong. Great to see some lesser known names venturing into the sauce world.

### FireFly Barbecue

[Reavers - Ghost Chilli Buffalo Sauce](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01J4H3MEK/) (5/10 heat level)

This is a very nice buffalo sauce. Creamy and has a salad cream smell. It's mostly butter and franks read hot but then they add some ghost chilli's to it for a kick. Not overly hot but lovely flavour and great for dipping chips into.

[Reavers - Carolina Reaper Hot Sauce ](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01J4H3MEK/)

[Reavers - Trinidad Scorpion Chipotle Sauce](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01J4H3MEK/) (7/10 heat level)

Also a great chip dip but it's way hotter than the buffalo sauce they make. Has a lovely smoky taste perhaps roasted garlic. Great with smoked ham or chicken.

### Skansk Chili

[Skansk Chili - Organic Mango Habanero Hot Sauce](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07FJVLXTW/)

Not very good value for money. Super small bottle.

### South Devon Chilli Farm

[Scorpion Chilli Sauce 50ml - Just Devon Chillies, No additives](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Scorpion-Chilli-Sauce-50ml-additives/dp/B01N8YKRJD) (7/10 heat level)

Super punchy sauce and so pure. Literally just chilli, vinegar and salt. This gives the sauce a real natural and raw flavour which is refreshing to see when so many sauces now just add extracts for heat.

Carolina Reaper Chilli Sauce 50ml - Just Devon Chillies, No additives (8/10 heat level)

This is really pure hot lava. Warning add this to the top of some pizza and then cook it for a insanely hot pizza.

### Tropical Sun

[Jamaican Scotch Bonnet Pepper Sauce](https://groceries.asda.com/product/sauces-seasonings/tropical-sun-jamaican-scotch-bonnet-pepper-sauce/1000049687462) (6/10 heat level)

Sweet and fruity hot sauce. You can taste a nice mango fruit with a decent kick of heat. Goes well with chips and makes an awesome dipping sauce when mixed with ketchup.

### Eaton's

[Jamaican Scotch Bonnet Pepper Sauce](https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/gb/groceries/eatons-jamaican-scotch-bonnet-pepper-sauce-148ml) (6/10 heat level)

I prefer this over Tropical Sun's version. It has less ingredients and tastes a little more natural. Very sweet, tangy and has slightly more heat. Recommended for flavour alone!

### Heartbreaking Dawn's

[Fervor Carolina Reaper Chile Hot Sauce](https://www.hot-headz.com/heartbreaking-dawns-fervor-reaper-chile-hot-sauce) (7/10)

Very hot and very flavourful. Goes great to spice up some mac n cheese or on a burger.

[Cauterizer Trinidad Socrpion](https://www.hot-headz.com/heartbreaking-dawns-1498-cauterizer-trinidad-socrpion)

[Southwestern Chocolate Habanero Hot Sauce](https://www.hot-headz.com/heartbreaking-dawns-southwestern-chocolate-habanero-hot-sauce)

[1841 Pear & Apple Ghost Pepper Hot Sauce](https://www.hot-headz.com/heartbreaking-dawns-1841-pear-apple-ghost-pepper-hot-sauce?)

[Reapercussion 7 Pod Primo Facef#@$er Hot Sauce!](https://www.hot-headz.com/Heartbreaking-dawns-reapercussion-carolina-reaper-hot-sauce)

### Karma Sauces

[Burn After Eating Hot Sauce](https://www.hot-headz.com/Burn-After-Eating-Hot-Sauce) (10/10)

A serious hot sauce. Very impressed with how how this is. There is some unusual spices in this which must kick it up a notch. Interesting unique flavour.

### Grim Reaper's

[Maverick Habanero Garlic Hot Sauce](https://www.hot-headz.com/grim-reaper-foods/grim-reapers-maverick-habanero-garlic-hot-sauce) (5/10)

Pretty great sauce with garlic and spice! Very enjoyable and easily used up.

[The Evil One!](https://www.hot-headz.com/the-evil-one) (5/10)

Sharp lime citrus? Didn't enjoy that much as overly sour lime.

### Hellfire

[Firearrhea Hot Sauce](https://www.hot-headz.com/Firearrhea-Hot-Sauce)

[Fear This!](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00YG5ARB2) (6/10)

Thick and chunky. Very strong indian curry spice flavour.

[Evil Bastard](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B06WW7NBG9) (8/10)

Quite loose and runny. Smoky BBQ.

[Fiery Fool](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07B6SJ82F) (5/10)

Not that hot compared to their other sauces. Nice tropical mango flavour. Good staple sauce.

### High River

[Tears Of The Sun Hot Sauce](https://www.hot-headz.com/tears-of-the-sun-hot-sauce) (2/10)

Another garlic heavy sauce but sweet peaches. Great as a cheese dipping sauce.

[Rogue Moruga Blood Orange Scorpion Hot Sau](https://www.hot-headz.com/high-river-sauces-rogue-moruga-blood-orange-scorpion-hot-sauce)

[Foo Foo Mama Choo Smokin' Ed's Carolina Reaper Sauce](https://www.hot-headz.com/high-river-sauces-foo-foo-mama-choo-smokin-eds--sauce)

### El Yucateco

[Red Habanero Pepper Sauce](https://www.hot-headz.com/el-yuceteco-hot-sauce/el-yucateco-red-habanero-pepper-sauce)

### Iguana

[Gold Island Pepper Sauce](https://www.hot-headz.com/Iguana-Gold-Island-Pepper-Sauce)

Garlic and carrot are most prevalent.

### Cajohn's

[Mongoose Hot Sauce](https://www.hot-headz.com/cajohns-mongoose-hot-sauce?) (9/10)

[El Chupacabra Hot Sauce](https://www.hot-headz.com/cajohns-el-chupacabra-hot-sauce) (5/10)

[The Reaper Slingblade Hot Sauce](https://www.hot-headz.com/the-reaper-slingblade-hot-sauce) (7/10)

[Trinidad Scorpion Hot Sauce](https://www.hot-headz.com/cajohns-trinidad-scorpion-hot-sauce-5oz) (8/10)

### Burns & McCoy

[Exhorresco 7 Pot Primo Hot Sauce](https://www.hot-headz.com/Burns-and-McCoy-Exhorresco-7Pot-Primo-Hot-Sauce?)

### Char Man

[Caribbean Hot Sauce](https://www.hot-headz.com/charman-Char-Man-Caribbean-Hot-Sauce)

### Torchbearer

[The Rapture Trinidad Scorpion Hot Sauce](https://www.hot-headz.com/Torchbearer-The-Rapture-Trinidad-Scorpion-Hot-Sauce)

### Hot-Headz!

[Satan's Revenge! Naga Chilli Sauce](https://www.hot-headz.com/satans-revenge-)

[Who Dares Burns! Naga Mustard Sauce](https://www.hot-headz.com/who-dares-burns-naga-mustard-sauce)


### Marie Sharp's

[Garlic Habanero Hot Sauce](https://www.hot-headz.com/Marie-Sharp's-Original-Garlic-Habanero-Hot-Sauce)

### Unknown/one off brand

[The Hottest Fuckin' Sauce](https://www.hotsauceemporium.co.uk/shop/hot-chilli-sauces/39/the-hottest-fuckin-sauce/) (6/10 heat level)

It's not that hot and I am quite disappointed in the marketing leading me to think otherwise. It seems to taste like it has extract in there too.

[Brother Bru-Bru's African Hot Sauce](https://www.hot-headz.com/Brother-Bru-Bru's-African-Hot-Sauce) (3/10)

Very flavourful spices with garlic but not too spicy. Worth it for the flavour experience.

[Tapatio Hot Sauce](https://www.hot-headz.com/tapatio-hot-sauce-large-296ml) (2/10)

Nice mexican style hot sauce for dipping chips.

[Acid Rain Hot Sauce Piquante](https://www.hot-headz.com/acid-rain-hot-sauce-piquante) (7/10)

Properly hot and complex flavour mix. Probably does contain acetic acids given the ingredients and slight acetic flavour.

[Valentina Salsa Picante Extra Hot Sauce](https://www.hot-headz.com/valentina-salsa-picante-extra-hot-sauce-370ml)

## Puree

### Cajohn's

[Cajohn's Trinidad Moruga Scorpion Puree](https://www.hot-headz.com/ukccacajohns-trinidad-moruga-scorpion-puree-2oz) (9/10)

### Chilli Mash Company

[Carolina Reaper Puree](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Carolina-Reaper-Chilli-Puree-Ingredients/dp/B077BWYX45) (9/10)

Doesn't last me long enough as it's only 41 ml. Otherwise nice addition to chilli when cooking.

## Extracts

### Mad Dog

[44 Magnum 4 Million Scovilles](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mad-Dog-Million-Scovilles-Extract/dp/B00170SKRC) (9/10 heat level)

You don't need any more concentrated extract that this! A few drops into a chip dip or chilli-con-carne helps heat it right up. However I believe I have built up a tolerance to extracts over the years as before just two drops in chilli-con-carne could cause me to nearly puke. Now I can use 4-6 and not really notice it.

## Peppers

### Fresh

#### Tesco

[Carolina Reaper](https://www.tescoplc.com/news/news-releases/2016/carolina-reaper-chilli-pepper/) (10/10 heat level)

This gave me some shooting ear pain when eating half of one raw. No other chilli product has done that to me yet! Seriously hot and not to be messed with. However I can add two into a chilli-con-carne or noodles and be fine eating it. It does sit in your gut though. This is also an extremely floral chilli, tastes a bit like eating perfume.

[Komodo Dragon](https://www.tescoplc.com/news/news-releases/2015/komodo-dragon-chilli-pepper-to-be-unleashed-across-britain/) (9/10 heat level)

This one is more edible raw than a Carolina Reaper. I eat most of one before but it does really heat up slowly after the fact. Whole mouth will be on fire. Lovely floral notes and not too overpowering.

### Dried

#### Chilli Wizards

[Carolina Reaper Dried Pods](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Chilli-Wizards-Carolina-Reaper-Dried/dp/B01KFR712M) (9/10 heat level)

Still very hot when dried but easier for me on the mouth and ears. However it will still be a real gut burner so go steady.

## Powders

### East End

[Chilli Powder Extra Hot](https://www.amazon.co.uk/East-End-Chilli-Powder-Extra/dp/B00DJ6COO2/) (6/10 heat level)

Great for adding some back end burning spice to any chilli dish or curry. Pretty hot for what you can find in a supermarket.

## Oils

### Lee Kum Kee

[Chiu Chow Chilli Oil](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lee-Kum-Kee-Chiu-Chilli/dp/B00TZT65BK) (4/10 heat level)

Has a bit of a dry chilli taste. Goes best with Cantonese dim sum. Haven’t used it on much else. I think I have had better chilli oils in Cantonese restaurants.

### Morrisons

[Chilli Infused Olive Oil](https://groceries.morrisons.com/webshop/product/Morrisons-The-Best-Infused-Chilli-Oil/344319011) (3/10 heat level)

I haven't found many uses for this yet.

### English Provender

[Very Lazy Red Chillies](https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/253637562) (5/10 heat level)

Useful for making a chilli or curry. It is a little on the vinegary side however. Will probably advise you stick with Lee Kum Kee.

## Snacks

### Chilli Wizards

[Carolina Reaper Chilli Bombay Mix](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Carolina-Reaper-Chilli-Bombay-Mix/dp/B01MR49A1F) (7/10 heat level)

It's your standard Bombay Mix but coated in Carolina Reaper dust. Great novelty snack for friends or if you really like Bombay Mix and chilli. Certainly builds heat the more you eat. Just watch your fingers as they end up being covered in reaper dust which can be inconvenient.

### Cajohn's

[Caboom Championship Chilli Fixin's](https://www.hot-headz.com/Cajohn's-Caboom-Championship-Chilli-Fixin's)
