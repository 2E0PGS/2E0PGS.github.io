## Sauces

[Psycho Juice - 70% Habanero](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dr-Burnoriums-Psycho-Juice-Habanero/dp/B005NNN6W8)

[Psycho Juice 70% - Red Savina](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psycho-Juice-70-Red-Savina/dp/B005MSZG22)

One of my favourite sauces for flavoring. Such a lovely flavor from this chili.

[Psycho Juice - Chipotle Ghost Pepper](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psycho-Juice-Chipotle-Ghost-Pepper/dp/B008CRD9HE)

It's not for me since theres roasted onions in it. However it works in a sauce to add complexity to the base.

[Psycho Juice - Roasted Garlic Ghost Pepper](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00O6TP6FA) (7/10 heat level)

Full of flavour and nice chunky thick sauce. Makes a great pizza dip. Not overly garicy incase your worried about that.

[Psycho Juice - 70% Ghost Pepper](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psycho-Juice-70-Ghost-Pepper/dp/B005MSE5KG)

[Psycho Juice - 70% Scorpion Pepper](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psycho-Juice-70-Scorpion-Pepper/dp/B00EZMNZMY) (8/10 heat level)

[Psycho Pickles - Ghost Pepper](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00ND6PYCW) (7/10 heat level)

My favorite gerkins/pickles. Lovely heat level just don't eat too many at once or you will pay for it tomorrow. Sweet fresh small gerkins.

[The Chili Alchemist - The Smoke Potion](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01EN8GFOE) (4/10 heat level)

[Dave's Gourmet - Naga Jolokia Ghost Pepper](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Daves-Gourmet-Jolokia-Ghost-Pepper/dp/B001PQTYN2)  (8/10 heat level)

[Ginger Beards Preserves - Fermented Scotch Sriracha](https://www.gingerbeardspreserves.co.uk/product/fermented-scotch-sriracha/) (7/10 heat level)

Brilliant sauce and slightly alcoholic tasting from the scotch blended.

[Ginger Beards Preserves - Habanero](https://www.gingerbeardspreserves.co.uk/product/habanero-hot-sauce/) (4/10 heat level)

Quite a chunky and thick sauce. Not overly hot but that's expected. Makes a great dipping sauce and great for guests to enjoy without blowing their head off. Many flavours and all natural.

[Ginger Beards Preserves - Moor Ghost Pepper Fusion](https://www.gingerbeardspreserves.co.uk/product/moor-ghost-pepper-fusion/) (8/10 heat level)

This is a damn excellent hot sauce. Made with real natural ingredients no fake flavouring. Seriously hot with serious flavour. This is a craft chili sauce made with craft beer! Two of my favourite things! Smokey, spicy and chunky.

[The Chili Peper Company - El Diablo](http://www.chileseeds.co.uk/products/el-diablo-hot-chilli-sauce-775.php)

Very hot sauce great in any noodle dish or chili con carne. A few spices like pepper.

[The Chili Peper Company - The Beast](http://www.chileseeds.co.uk/products/the-beast-hot-chilli-sauce-30.php)

Qutie a sweet sauce but good for sausages or other meats as a dip.

## Extracts

[Mad Dog - 44 Magnum 4 Million Scovilles](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mad-Dog-Million-Scovilles-Extract/dp/B00170SKRC) (9/10 heat level)

You don't need any more concentrated extract that this! A few drops into a chip dip or chili con carne helps heat it right up. However I believe I have built up a tollerance to extracts over the years as before just two drops in chili con carne could cause me to nearly puke. Now I can use 4-6 and not really notice it.

## Peppers

[Carolina Reaper]() (10/10 heat level)

This gave me some shooting ear pain when eating half of one raw. No other chili product has done that to me yet! Seriously hot and not to be messed with. However I can add two into a chili con carne or noodles and be fine eating it. It does sit in your gut though. This is also an extremely floral chili, tastes a bit like eating perfume.

[Komodo Dragon]() (9/10 heat level)

This one is more ediable raw than a Carolina Reaper. I eat most of one before but it does really heat up slowly after the fact. Whole mouth will be on fire. Lovely floral notes and not too overpowering.
