# Synth

If you cannot tell already I love synthesizers, keyboards, organs, pianos, beat-makers, drum machines and sequencers.

I will list some great YouTube finds of people sharing their synth session creativity. I believe a real show of someoneâ€™s musical talent is the ability to perform improvised or live.
