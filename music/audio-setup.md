# Audio Setup

This is a list of my current main HI-FI system setup. It does change now and then and I will try to keep this page updated to reflect that. I have also included a few portable audio devices in the list.

### Speakers

Aiwa SX NV-150 "twin duct three way bass reflex speaker system"

Decent speakers with a strong bass. Surprising quality when I have compared them to much more expensive kevlar speakers. However I would still like to upgraded them at some point.

### Amplifier

[NAD Stero Amplifier 3020i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAD_3020) (1978 ish)

Clear audio amp with lots of punch for its size. It's probably one of my favorite amps I ever used. Simple interface without lots of useless features.

### CD player

[Sony CDP-XE900E](http://www.audioreview.com/product/digital-sources/cd-players/sony/cdp-xe900.html) (1996)

Very good CD player has all the features I need and a nice clear large display. Solid built CD tray which uses a "Fixed Pick-up Mechanism".

### Vinyl deck

[Technics SL-Q2](https://www.vinylengine.com/library/technics/sl-q2.shtml) (1979-1981)

I love the automatic function of this deck. It means I wont wear out my stylus if I leave the room and the vinyl finishes playing. The arm will automatically park up. The direct drive for me is better with less to go wrong and the quartz tracking seems to work well.

### Vinyl needle/cartridge

[ADC QLM 33 MKIII](https://www.turntableneedles.com/RSQ33-Type-Needle-for-ADC-QLM-33-MKIII--our-Needle-111-DEC_p_856.html)

Great quality audio. Nice bass and treble response.

### DAC

[Realtek ALC887]()

This is the DAC in my main personal desktop and it's fantastic for a motherboard built in HD audio.

[FiiO E10K](https://www.headfonia.com/fiio-e10k-classic-reborn/)

I mainly use this DAC on the PC at work and it fixes all the PC PSU line noise problems I was having before. The lower end bass on this is a bit better than the Realtek ALC887 I reckon as it manages to shake my headphones just that bit extra. I don't however use the bass-boost mode but I do use the high-gain switch.

### Ear-Canal headphones

[Sennheiser CX 475](https://www.stuff.tv/sennheiser/cx-475/review)

Great quality however the bass is lacking unless it's snug in the ear. Drives well of the phones DAC. The treble response is brilliant.

### Bluetooth speaker

[KitSound Miami](https://mcd.kitsound.co.uk/product/details/35929/KitSound/Miami_Wireless_Speaker_Tesco_Exclusive/Wired_Speakers/)

Great bass for such a small device. Long battery life that lasts roughly a solid day of playback. Stereo speakers, micro USB support and AUX input. Cost me Â£30 from Tesco UK and I would purchase a Kitsound bluetooth speaker again if I ever loose this one. Compares to more expensive Bose and MiniRig portable speakers.

### Headphones

todo

### MiniDisk player

[Sony Walkman MZ-R410](http://www.minidisc.org/part_Sony_MZ-R410.html)

The MZ-R410 has a record facility so that's what I mainly use it for. Takes a single AA battery.

[Sony Walkman MZ-E62](http://www.minidisc.org/part_Sony_MZ-E60.html)

I use the MZ-E62 more since it has the remote control and great bass boost. Takes a single AA battery.
